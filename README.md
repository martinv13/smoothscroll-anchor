# Smooth scrolling to anchor links
Yet another script to perform smooth scrolling.
It is non intrusive, light and without any dependency.

Just paste/source the script somewhere, it will replace anchor links, i.e. `<a href="#home">Home</a>`, with their smooth equivalent.

Tested on Chrome, IE, Safari, Edge.
